# Submarine.js
Submarine.js is a Javascript library that targets the browser.
It's designed to make it easy for developers to integrate Shopify Plus stores with [Submarine](https://getsubmarine.com), a platform for designing bespoke tokenised payment experiences like subscriptions, presales, and one-click upsells.
The platform (and this repository) is built and maintained by [Disco Labs](https://www.discolabs.com), a Shopify Plus partner agency.
